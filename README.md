# BOREALIS
the BeamfOrmed Radio Emission AnaLysIS (BOREALIS) pipeline

Authors: Jake D. Turner, Jean-Mathias Griessmeier, Phillipe Zarka, and I. Vasylieva

The BOREALIS pipeline was created to search for auroral radio emission from exoplanets in radio beamformed data. However, the BOREALIS pipeline can be applied to any beamformed data and currently works with LOFAR, NenuFAR, UTR-2, and the LoTSS LOFAR-HBA survey (beamformed data extracted from visibilities) data. Boreas is the mythical north wind god in Greek mythology and was believed to cause the northern lights on Earth to dance. In 1619, Galileo Galilei coined the term “Aurora Borealis” for the northern lights named after Aurora, the Roman goddess of the dawn, and the Greek god Boreas.
